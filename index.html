<h3>What do you want to do with technology?</h3>
<p>I aim to use this device to prototype a live captions service that integrates with the Timekettle M3. People who are hard of hearing/deaf could carry an additional app that would have almost no latency due to directly connecting to the Timekettle and using its translated words.</p>

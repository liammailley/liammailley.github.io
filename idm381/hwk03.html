                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Google Translate is the world's most popular translation software.
                         The version being used here is the Android mobile app version.
                         This version features a "Conversation" feature, in which a button can be pressed that allows each side of a conversation to speak one-by-one and get translated.
                         It also allows for users to translate one language at a time.
                    </p>
                    <h3>What does it do well?</h3>
                    <ul>
                         <li>Internationally recognizable interface and brand, no need to convey purpose of translator</li>
                         <li>Split screen evenly between the two languages</li>
                         <li>Users can easily choose whether to have Google search for one language at a time, or have it translate the whole conversation with the Auto feature</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>What does it NOT do well?</h3>
                    <ul>
                         <li>While it does allow for editing of text, it is not a great system. Only the person who most recently spoke can edit, and these edits often interrupt the automatic microphone turn-on. Improvements could be made to how users take turns interacting with the system, such as having a "correction phase" where misheard words can be corrected before the translation is even read out. </li>
                         <li>Latency is also a bit of a problem</li>
                         <li>Accuracy of translated words tends to be low</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Best use of hardware, or same-O same-O?</h3>
                    <p>This is the most recognizable and understandable text-based translation software out there. It does the most it can with the limited hardware of a smartphone microphone. However, with the Timekettle M3 earbuds' high accuracy and low latency, the clunkiness of this app could be worked out.</p>

                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>
                         ElevenLabs is a company that focuses in generative voice AI.
                         This product specifically allows for a free way for one to let an AI dub over a video or audio into a different lanugage.
                         There are a fairly large amount of languages available, and the end result is a very impressively clean dub.

                    <p>Uses AI voice technology to its fullest extent, but is unable to generate any text to go with it. This is not using the full range of AI-based abilities available right now, but could be improved upon for my final idea.</p>

                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>Forum is a translator app designed specifically for confrences.
                         It allows for near-instant one-sided translation of a single language from a single speaker.
                         This translation allows for lectures or classes to be understood in a completely different language in real time.

                    <ul>
                         <li>Designed for a 1-sided lecture or confrence, so does not support a conversation</li>
                         <li>Shows the text for both languages, but highlights only one language</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Best use of hardware, or same-O same-O?</h3>
                    <p>This technology makes use of AI to provide text translations, but doesn't support the two-sided nature of a conversation. An app like this with a conversation focus would be the perfect solution.</p>

               <h3>Summary</h3>
               <p>Speakeasy will be an iOS or Android interface that connects to the Timekettle M3 translator earbuds.
                    Its main purpose is to allow users to quickly fix the text of their speech any time the device mishears them.
                    Users should be able to quickly and cleanly access any translated text and easily retype it.
                    The interface should be usable from opposite angles, so as to allow users to hold the device between them while communicating.
                    Once changed, the interface would play a translated audio, using AI to recreate the audio with applied changes to text.
                    The interface would facilitate the nature of a conversation, freely allowing editing while still recording conversation.
